## PM Updates

- **2026-09-21 [SUBSTANTIVE]** — Two spec clarifications added to the PRD (Revision 3):
  - **AC-013 (MOD-004 Send Logging)**: After a send is successfully logged, the ascent list on the route detail screen must refresh immediately to show the new entry without requiring re-navigation. Addresses the known stale-list-after-modal-submission pattern (see Skill Recommendations).
  - **AC-036 (MOD-005 Beta Video)**: While a beta video is uploading, a progress overlay showing upload progress (0–100%) must be displayed. The overlay blocks further interaction until upload completes or fails, preventing double-submission.
  - Module boundaries, dependencies, and the phase plan are unchanged. No new modules added. Impact is confined to MOD-004 and MOD-005 specs; Doc-Sync must sync both.

## Skill Recommendations

- **Cross-module i18n catalog updates**: When a module adds user-facing strings, the engineer must also update `locales/en/common.json` and `locales/zh-TW/common.json`. The self-check script's git scope check flags these as "out of scope" but they are required by the production.md i18n convention. The self-check script should be updated to whitelist `locales/` as an allowed cross-cutting path for any module implementing i18n strings. Alternatively, each module should own its own locale namespace file (e.g. `locales/en/routes.json`) to stay within the module boundary.

- **React Native named colors for enum-to-color mappings**: When a domain enum (like route hold colors) needs to render as a visual chip, map enum values to React Native's built-in named color strings (e.g. `'red'`, `'blue'`) rather than hex literals. Named colors are OS-resolved (not hardcoded hex), satisfy the "no hardcoded hex" convention, and are visually accurate. Document this in the skill as an approved pattern for enum-color mapping in RN components.

- **Generated column formula must match spec exactly**: When a spec and production.md both document a Postgres GENERATED ALWAYS AS formula, verify the migration SQL matches character-for-character (including separators). Even cosmetic differences (e.g., adding `-` separators not in the spec formula) are spec deviations that QA must flag, even when there is zero functional impact. Add this to qa-checklist references as a pattern to check on any module with a GENERATED ALWAYS AS column.

- **Frontend modules: stale list after modal submission**: When a modal form submits and closes, any list rendered outside the modal (in the parent screen) will NOT re-fetch unless explicitly triggered. The standard pattern is to pass a refresh callback from the list to the success handler, or use a context/event bus. QA should check this pattern on every frontend module where a modal creates a new item that should appear in a visible list.

- **Frontend modules: "success confirmation" spec language is ambiguous**: Specs that say "Success confirmation shown to user" without specifying the form (toast, banner, or implicit modal dismissal) will generate a spec issue on every frontend module. PM should standardize this language in the spec template to specify the required UX pattern (e.g., "display a toast/snackbar message" vs. "dismiss the modal").
